# Camera Integration for ONEVER PIR-Triggered Squirrel Monitoring System

Motion-activated cameras can successfully integrate with your existing ONEVER PIR sensor and Evictor strobe light setup, requiring an AC-to-DC relay interface to bridge the voltage difference between the 110V AC PIR output and low-voltage camera trigger inputs. This integration allows simultaneous operation of both deterrent strobe and recording camera from a single motion detection event. The key technical challenge involves converting the ONEVER's AC relay output to a dry contact trigger suitable for modern IP cameras, which typically require 3.3V DC logic signals. Multiple camera options exist with external trigger capabilities, ranging from professional IP cameras to modified trail cameras, each offering different advantages for indoor squirrel monitoring.

## Understanding your existing ONEVER PIR system

The ONEVER PIR motion sensor operates as an AC power switch rather than providing a DC voltage output. **The sensor runs on 110V AC power and outputs switched 110V AC through its relay when motion is detected**, with a maximum load capacity of 30W. The sensor uses a 3-wire configuration: blue (neutral), brown (line input), and red (line output to connected devices). This AC switching design currently powers your Evictor strobe light directly but requires an interface module to trigger cameras that expect low-voltage DC signals.

The detection specifications include a 120-180 degree field of view with 2-8 meter range, adjustable sensitivity, and timing delays from 5 seconds to 4 minutes. These parameters work well for squirrel detection, providing reliable triggering while avoiding excessive false alarms from smaller movements.

## Camera models with external trigger capabilities

### Professional IP cameras for reliable integration

The **Hikvision DS-2CD2532F-IS** emerges as the top recommendation at $150-200, offering 3MP resolution with built-in alarm input/output ports specifically designed for external sensor integration. This dome camera features 10-meter infrared night vision, Power over Ethernet support, and accepts dry contact triggers through its terminal block connections. The camera can start recording within 0.5 seconds of trigger activation and supports pre-recording buffers when used with a compatible NVR system.

For those seeking higher resolution, the **Viewtron IP-D4-x series** provides 4MP or 8MP options at $180-250. These cameras excel at small animal detection with 100-foot IR range and dedicated alarm input terminals supporting both normally open and normally closed sensor configurations. **The pre-record buffer feature captures 3-10 seconds before the trigger event**, ensuring you never miss the initial squirrel activity that activated the sensor.

Budget-conscious users should consider the **Reolink RLC-510A** at $120-150, though it requires an RLN36 NVR ($200 additional) to enable external trigger functionality. This combination provides exceptional 5MP image quality with proven small animal detection capabilities and supports pre-trigger recording through the NVR's alarm inputs.

### Specialized wildlife camera options

The **Stealth Cam DS4K MAX** represents an interesting alternative approach. Originally designed as a trail camera, it can be modified for AC power operation and external triggering at a total cost around $270. This camera offers the highest resolution at 32MP for still images and 4K video, with a lightning-fast 0.4-second trigger speed optimized specifically for wildlife monitoring. The no-glow IR flash won't disturb animals or create visible light in your living room.

For applications requiring the absolute fastest response time, the **LUCID Vision Phoenix camera** with GPIO inputs provides sub-microsecond trigger latency at $300-450. This industrial-grade solution offers unparalleled timing precision for capturing rapid squirrel movements but requires PC-based recording software rather than standalone operation.

## Critical interface requirements for PIR-to-camera connection

Since the ONEVER PIR outputs 110V AC and cameras require 3.3V DC trigger signals, **you must use an interface relay module** to safely connect these systems. The recommended solution uses a 12V DC relay module with opto-isolation, preventing any possibility of high voltage reaching the camera.

The basic interface circuit requires:
- **AC-to-DC conversion module** accepting 110V AC input and providing isolated 12V DC output
- **3.3V opto-isolated relay** with dry contact output for camera triggering
- **Protection diodes** (1N4007) across relay coils to prevent voltage spikes
- **Terminal blocks** for secure, organized connections

This interface module connects between the ONEVER's red output wire and the camera's alarm input terminals, effectively translating the AC switching signal into a camera-compatible trigger.

## Complete wiring solution using DPDT relay method

The most robust integration approach uses a Double Pole Double Throw (DPDT) relay to control both devices independently from a single PIR trigger. This configuration provides complete electrical isolation between the high-voltage strobe circuit and low-voltage camera system while maintaining synchronized operation.

### Required components for DPDT integration:
- **12V DPDT relay** (Omron MY2NJ-12VDC recommended, $15-20)
- **12V DC power supply** rated for 1-2 amps ($10-15)
- **Bridge rectifier** for AC-to-DC conversion ($5)
- **BC547 NPN transistor** for signal amplification ($1)
- **1kΩ current limiting resistor** ($0.50)
- **1N4007 flyback protection diodes** x2 ($1)
- **Weather-resistant junction box** for connections ($10)

### Wiring configuration step-by-step:

1. **PIR signal processing**: Connect the ONEVER's red output wire through a bridge rectifier to convert AC to DC. Add a 1kΩ resistor in series with the BC547 transistor's base for current limiting.

2. **Relay driver circuit**: Wire the BC547's collector to the positive terminal of the DPDT relay coil, with the 12V supply negative connected to both the relay's negative terminal and transistor emitter. Install a 1N4007 diode across the relay coil for spike protection.

3. **Device connections**: Use the DPDT relay's first pole to switch 120V AC to the Evictor strobe light. Connect the second pole as a dry contact closure for the camera trigger input, with the common terminal to camera ground and normally open contact to the trigger pin.

4. **Safety considerations**: House all AC connections in proper junction boxes with appropriate wire gauges (14 AWG minimum). Install a 15-amp circuit breaker for overcurrent protection and use GFCI outlets where applicable.

## Storage options and recording capabilities

Modern IP cameras offer flexible storage solutions to match your monitoring needs:

**Local storage** through MicroSD cards provides the simplest solution, with most cameras supporting 128-256GB cards enabling several days of motion-triggered recording. Look for cameras with loop recording functionality to automatically overwrite old footage when the card fills.

**Network Video Recorder (NVR) systems** offer enhanced capabilities including pre-trigger recording buffers, longer retention periods, and centralized management. The Hikvision and Viewtron cameras work seamlessly with their respective NVR systems, typically adding $200-400 to the total cost but providing 3-10 second pre-recording that captures activity before the PIR trigger.

**Cloud storage** subscriptions from manufacturers like Reolink and Hikvision cost $3-10 monthly but provide off-site backup and remote access capabilities. This proves valuable for reviewing footage away from home or protecting recordings if equipment is damaged.

## Night vision performance for indoor use

All recommended cameras feature infrared LED illumination providing clear night vision without visible light that might disturb your living space. **The Hikvision DS-2CD2532F-IS offers 10-meter IR range perfectly sized for indoor rooms**, while avoiding the over-illumination common with outdoor-rated 100-foot IR cameras.

For optimal night vision results in living rooms, position cameras to avoid IR reflection from windows or glass surfaces. The camera's IR LEDs should not directly face reflective surfaces, and mounting height between 6-8 feet typically provides the best coverage angle for capturing squirrel activity at floor level.

Consider cameras with "smart IR" technology that automatically adjusts illumination intensity based on subject distance, preventing overexposure of nearby objects while maintaining visibility of distant areas.

## Conclusion

Integrating a motion-activated camera with your ONEVER PIR sensor and Evictor strobe light system requires careful attention to electrical compatibility but yields a powerful monitoring solution. The combination of PIR-triggered recording eliminates false alarms from shadows or light changes while ensuring immediate capture of actual squirrel activity. By using a DPDT relay interface, both deterrent and documentation functions operate simultaneously from a single motion event, maximizing system effectiveness while maintaining safe electrical isolation between high and low voltage components.
