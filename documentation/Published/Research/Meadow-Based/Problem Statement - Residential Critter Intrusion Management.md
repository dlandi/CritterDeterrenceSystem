## Problem Statement: Residential Critter Intrusion Management

### Problem Overview
Homeowners face persistent intrusions from squirrels and other small animals in attics and living spaces, causing property damage, health hazards, and security concerns. Current solutions are either ineffective (ultrasonic devices), inhumane (poisons/traps), or require costly professional intervention.

### Key Challenges
- **Detection Gap**: Traditional security systems ignore small animal intrusions
- **Response Timing**: Manual intervention occurs after damage is done
- **Evidence Collection**: Insurance claims lack documentation of intrusion events  
- **Coordination**: Single-point deterrents allow animals to relocate within the structure

### Impact
- Structural damage from gnawing and nesting ($500-5,000 per incident)
- Fire hazards from chewed electrical wiring
- Health risks from droppings and parasites
- Sleep disruption and quality of life degradation
- Recurring pest control expenses ($200-500 per visit)

### Solution Requirements
An automated system must provide:
- Real-time detection and immediate deterrent response
- Multi-zone coordination to prevent relocation
- Evidence capture for insurance/pest control
- Remote monitoring and control capabilities
- Humane, non-lethal deterrence methods
- Professional-grade reliability without professional installation costs

### Current Market Gap
Existing products address only single aspects (cameras OR deterrents OR alarms) without integrated intelligence. No solution currently offers cloud-coordinated, multi-zone response with evidence capture at a prosumer price point.
